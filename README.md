# Project overview

This is the first project from the **React** section of the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-cv-application)!

The aim here was to create a small CV application, where users can input their personal details, education and work experiences.

A live preview is available [here](https://react-cv-app-2db128.netlify.app/).
